Work from https://adventofcode.com

These are my collected coding solutions for Advent of Code.

The goal is to provide proof of coding solutions. All solutions should be 
executable and display the answer to the problem presented.

Solutions may be written in any language. When available, a shell script
should be available to execute in a standard shell.
